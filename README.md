# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


# Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to find out how many employees are upcoming for retirement. We are also looking to see how many people are in the position for mentorship.
Our company is worried we won't have the employees enough to cover the retirees. 

# Senior Postions Retiring

As we can see a large majority of the position that are leaving are senior postion and is why we need to look into the mentorship program. 

# Mentorship Program!

We have run a query to see how many people would be eligible for the mentorship program. We end up with 56859 results for people who could be in the mentorship program.

# Results

We need to get on the ball with our mentorship program because we are going to lose a lot of people to retirement. Luckily we have found plenty of candidates to start the process.
